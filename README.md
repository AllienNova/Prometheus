> **Unleashing the Power of AI Automation for All**

## Overview

Prometheus is an open-source AI Automation Platform built on the foundation of OpenManus, designed to surpass commercial alternatives with exceptional performance and user experience. This platform democratizes access to advanced AI capabilities, removing barriers and enabling users to automate complex tasks across web and mobile platforms.

## Vision

Just as Prometheus gave fire to humanity in Greek mythology, our platform aims to take the restricted power of AI automation and make it accessible to everyone. We're building a platform that combines the advanced capabilities of commercial solutions with the openness, flexibility, and community-driven innovation of the open-source model.

## Key Features

- **Intuitive User Interface**: User-centric design with easy navigation, real-time interaction, and customization options
- **Advanced Natural Language Understanding**: Sophisticated conversational AI capabilities for intuitive task setup and management
- **Complex Workflow Management**: Systems for handling multi-layered workflows with dependency tracking and prioritization
- **Cross-Platform Functionality**: Seamless experience across web and mobile platforms with real-time synchronization
- **Performance Optimization**: Scalable architecture with resource-efficient algorithms and parallel task execution
- **Expandability**: Modular extension system for integrating additional tools and functionalities
- **Enterprise-Grade Security**: End-to-end encryption and robust user data protection

## Current Status

Prometheus is currently in the Foundation Phase of development. We are establishing the core architecture, enhancing the OpenManus foundation, and developing the API layer.
