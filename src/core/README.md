# Prometheus Core

This directory contains the core components of the Prometheus AI Automation Platform, building upon the OpenManus framework to provide a solid foundation for scientific research and automation capabilities.

## Components

- **Engine**: The central processing engine that coordinates all platform activities
- **Reasoning**: Advanced reasoning capabilities for complex problem-solving
- **Knowledge**: Knowledge representation and management systems
- **Planning**: Task planning and execution management
- **Memory**: Short and long-term memory systems for context retention
- **Integration**: Core integration points for extensions and modules

## Implementation Plan

The core components will be implemented with a focus on scientific research capabilities:
1. Enhanced reasoning for scientific hypothesis generation and testing
2. Specialized knowledge representation for scientific domains
3. Advanced planning for complex research workflows
4. Memory systems optimized for scientific data retention and retrieval

## Dependencies

- OpenManus core framework
- Python 3.10+
- TensorFlow/PyTorch for advanced reasoning
- Graph databases for knowledge representation
