# Prometheus Scientific Research Modules

This directory contains the specialized scientific research capabilities of the Prometheus AI Automation Platform. These modules enable deep, intricate scientific discoveries and research through advanced data analysis, visualization, and integration with scientific databases and APIs.

## Components

- **Data Analysis**: Advanced statistical analysis, machine learning, and pattern recognition algorithms specialized for scientific research
- **Visualization**: Interactive data visualization tools for complex scientific datasets
- **Database Integration**: Connectors for scientific databases and research repositories
- **Experiment Workflow**: Tools for designing, executing, and tracking scientific experiments
- **Publication Tools**: Assistance with formatting research for publication and citation management
- **Collaborative Research**: Features for multi-researcher collaboration and knowledge sharing

## Implementation Plan

The scientific capabilities will be implemented in phases:
1. Core scientific architecture design
2. Data analysis and visualization modules
3. Database and API integration
4. Experiment workflow system
5. Research publication tools
6. Collaborative research features

## Dependencies
